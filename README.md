# The-Sparks-Foundation-Internship
Welcome to the Sparks Foundation Internship repository! This project focuses on implementing a Decision Tree model to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features using the famous Iris dataset.

# About the Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic and straightforward dataset often used as a beginner's dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and the corresponding species of iris flowers.

# Project Overview
In this repository, you'll find the code implementing a Decision Tree algorithm to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features. Decision Trees are powerful and interpretable models commonly used for classification tasks. This project serves as a hands-on example for understanding Decision Tree algorithms and their application in real-world datasets.
